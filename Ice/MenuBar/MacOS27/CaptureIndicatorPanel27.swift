/// macOS has one of its own, but it belongs to Control Centre, and Control Centre's modules are
/// gone from the bar while any assessment assertion is live — which is to say, whenever Ice hides
/// anything. Nothing in the assertion can spare them (measured on macOS 27.0 against every system
/// item number up to 127, Control Centre's bundle identifier and the capturing application's), so
/// the only way to leave the user that indicator is to draw it.
///
/// Clicking it opens Control Centre, where the camera's own controls — Video Effects, Mic Mode —
/// live during a call. Control Centre is the one system item that opens from an Accessibility
/// press while items are concealed, so the click costs no reveal.
